# <p align="center"> Who are we? </p>


## <p align="center"> Case Introduction </p>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>Innovation is not a one-size-fits-all process; different personas have varying levels of experience, face distinct challenges, and have unique needs. Existing solutions often lack personalized guidance, leading to disengagement when users do not feel adequately supported. Many abandon the innovation process due to a lack of tailored insights relevant to their specific situation.</p>

<h3>Expected Final Product</h3>
<p>The AI-powered Innovation Coach should ensure that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Users are onboarded based on their current innovation level and knowledge.</li>
     <li>A dynamic user journey that evolves with user progress, providing relevant next steps.</li>
    <li>Industry-specific personalization is provided (e.g., an engineer receives different recommendations than a baker).</li>
    <li>The platform enables interactive engagement, answering questions in real-time and keeping users motivated.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Users</h3>
<p>SME in the Canton of St. Gallen with the following profiles:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>The Clueless</strong> – Unfamiliar with innovation; requires education and exposure.</li>
    <li><strong>The Unmotivated</strong> – Aware of innovation but lacks motivation; requires incentives.</li>
    <li><strong>The Motivated</strong> – Eager to innovate but needs direction and resources.</li>
    <li><strong>The Penniless</strong> – Has ideas but lacks funding; requires financial support.</li>
    <li><strong>The Hesitant</strong> – Interested but afraid of risks; needs confidence and safety nets.</li>
</ul>
<p>The solution should include as many users as possible, but at least three.</p>
